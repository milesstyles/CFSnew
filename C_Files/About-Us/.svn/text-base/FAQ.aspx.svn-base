     <p><strong>2) Why should I use CenterfoldStrips.Com?</strong></p>
     <p>Gorgeous   Entertainers: We are extremely picky about the entertainers we hire. Our   gorgeous centerfold models have been featured on television, Hollywood movies,   in the top adult magazines, and in the hottest gentlemen's clubs around the   globe! The are known for their class, sex appeal, and outstanding personalities. </p>
     <p>Reliability: Our entertainers actually show up to your party. You   would be surprised by the great number of phone calls we receive on Saturday   night from people who booked from a different company and their talent never   showed up.</p>
     <p>Price: Our prices are extremely reasonable. We also   fulfill what we advertise. Don't be fooled by places that charge a little less   than us for the dancer, but then charge almost double that when the dancer shows   up because their price didn't include &quot;nudity&quot;. Peace of Mind: Once you have a dancer reserved with us,   you no longer have to worry about entertainment. After your initial reservation   is completed, it is not necessary for you to call us to confirm. However, it is   important to call us with your room number if your event is booked at a hotel.   Of course, if at any time you have any questions, you can call our customer   service line.</p>
     <p><strong>3) How does this work?</strong></p>
     <p>It starts with a phone   call from you to our toll free line at 877.427.8747 where you will speak to one   of our friendly, professional booking agents who are fully committed to helping   you plan the entertainment for your party at an affordable price. You may also   book entertainment directly through our website at <a href="http://www.centerfoldstrips.com/Entertainers/Booking.aspx">http://www.centerfoldstrips.com/Entertainers/Booking.aspx</a> <br />
          <br />
          <strong>4)   What information does the agent need to help me?</strong></p>
     <p>We need to know the city,   state, and zip code of the party, the date of the party, the type of party, the   budget set aside for entertainment, the number of guests attending the party,   and the type of entertainment needed. </p>
     <p><strong>5) What is my   entertainment budget?</strong></p>
     <p>When you are planning   a party bear in mind that all party guests are going to be chipping in, so the   cost is distributed over the total amount of people. For Example   if you have 20 guests attending the party &amp; the bill is $200.00 the   cost is only $10.00 per person!  So, you must first know exactly how many   guests will be attending the party. Then you must calculate how much each person   will contribute toward the entertainment bill. That will give you your total entertainment budget.   Important Fact - <u>THE   ENTERTAINMENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE PARTY!</u> It is the number one   thing that the party guests are going to remember, and talk about for years to   come. No one will care or remember what kind of food was served or what kind of   beer they drank. What people will always remember &amp; talk about is the world   class performance they saw &amp; experienced from our Centerfold   Strippers!<br />
          <br />
          <strong>6) What   forms of payment do you accept?</strong></p>
     <p>We accept Visa, MasterCard,   PayPal, and Cash. A small deposit is usually   placed on your credit card, upon your approval, and the balance is paid   to the entertainers in cash upon arrival. Other arrangements can be made as   well. Just call one of agents for assistance. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>7) How will the charge appear on my credit card statement?</strong></p>
     <p>It will not say Centerfold Strips. It will be discreet and not mention   anything about strippers.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>8)   Where can I have my party? </strong></p>
     <p>Anywhere you would like. Centerfold Strips entertainers perform at restaurants,   bars, offices, professional offices, doctors offices, hospital rooms, hotels,   motels, private homes, apartments, catering halls, limousines, limo buses,   private party halls, vfw halls, elks lodges, American legion halls, or   absolutely any location. It is imperative that you get permission from the   management of venue if it is privately owned, BEFORE you book entertainment   there. If you are planning a hotel party, they will never give you permission,   so don't even bother to ask. We have done thousands of hotel parties - the key   to it is to keep the noise level down to a minimum, so you do not get kicked   out. When booking a hotel party with us, upon making your reservation, we will   need to know the first and last name of the person whose name the room is   reserved under. It is imperative that you call us immediately when you check   into the hotel with the exact room # that you want the entertainment to arrive   at. </p>
     <p><strong>9) I would like to   have my party in a remote location like a Caribbean island. Is that   possible?</strong></p>
     <p>Yes we can fly our entertainers to you anywhere on the   planet. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>10) How many   people do I need to have a party?</strong></p>
     <p>Three is the minimum.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>11) How old does everyone have to be at my   party?</strong></p>
     <p>Eighteen is the minimum age to attend any of our events. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>12) How long do the   entertainers dance for and do they dance nude?</strong></p>
     <p>Male entertainers usually do a   half hour strip show down to a g-string. However we can accommodate hour shows   both nude and g-string. Females usually do an hour show and it is nude unless   otherwise specified. The exception is if you are having a mixed crowd at your   party (both male and female guests) the bottoms stay on for all entertainers. We   can always accommodate special requests. Just ask an agent.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>13) What do I need to have ready at the time of   the entertainers arrival?</strong></p>
     <p>Please have the balance of the money ready in cash   to be given to the entertainer upon their arrival. Also they will need a private   room to change in. This could even be a bathroom. Have ample chairs available   for your guests so everyone is seated comfortably and can see the   show.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>14) Do you have midget   strippers and how much are they?</strong></p>
     <p>Well first let me say this is the most   popular question as of lately. They prefer to be called &quot;little people&quot; and the   males start at $350.00 and up if they are locally available in your area, and   the females start at $750.00 and up if they are locally available in your area.   The price depends on how much travel the little person has to do to attend your   party. And no they are not cheaper because they are smaller. They are more   expensive because they are extremely scarce &amp; in high   demand.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>15) Do you have   other novelty acts?</strong></p>
     <p>Yes! We have big beautiful woman (overweight female   strippers), senior citizen strippers, drag queens, celebrity impersonators,   dj's, party chefs, magicians, comedians, cigar rollers, and many more acts are   being added every day.  <br />
          <br />
          <strong>16) What is the 30 minute window and why is it   necessary?</strong></p>
     <p>This is for the entertainer's arrival time. We always require a 30   minute window for the entertainer's arrival time in case the entertainer is   delayed for any reason such as traffic, parking, construction, or   other delays. So when booking please   provide this 1/2 hour window to the agent. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>17) What happens if I am forced to cancel my   entertainment?</strong></p>
     <p>There is a $100.00 dollar cancellation fee for each   entertainer that you have reserved that will be charged to the credit card on   file. It is a $250.00 dollar cancellation fee for all novelty acts. If you   cancel within 24 hours of the time and date of the event then you will be   responsible &amp; charged for the entire amount.   <br />
          <br />
          <strong>18) What is your return   policy?</strong></p>
     <p>There isn't one under any circumstances. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>19) Do I need to supply the   music?</strong></p>
     <p>Absolutely. We only supply the talent. It is the clients   responsibility to provide music for their event. All of our dancers are   professional and will dance to whatever you choose to listen   to. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>20) Is tipping the   entertainer included in the price I was charged?</strong></p>
     <p>No. There is no mandatory   gratuity but in order to get a great performance from the entertainer we   strongly suggest having everyone prepared to tip accordingly. We recommend going   to the bank before the event, to get stacks of singles so you can make change   for your guests. All entertainers work for tips, and appreciate   gratuities. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>21) Can I   take pictures during the show?</strong></p>
     <p>NO. Centerfold Strips &amp; the entertainers   have a strict no photograph or video policy. If a party guests is caught taking photos -   we reserve the right to confiscate   the film, or erase digital images.  </p>
     <p><strong>22) Do you offer massage,   escorts, or one on one shows? </strong></p>
     <p>No, no, and no. We stay clear of anything that   even remotely resembles prostitution or anything illegal. If the   entertainers are being propositioned for any sexual services, the show will be   terminated immediately &amp; you and or your guest/s will be prosecuted to the   fullest extent of the law. <br />
          <br />
     <strong>23) I gave my cell phone as the contact number   for the party. What if the battery dies or I have no signal?</strong></p>
     <p>No problem that   is why we take an alternate contact and their cell number as well. <br />
          <br />
     <strong>24) How far in advance   should I reserve entertainment?</strong></p>
     <p>As far in advance as possible is recommended,   but we will accommodate all requests even same day service if we   can.<br />

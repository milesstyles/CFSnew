   <p>Just wanted to say thanks for the girls for my brother's bachelor  party on Saturday night. All four were phenomenal entertainers and  beautiful girls. Their bodies and personalities were outstanding and  they made the event as fun as any bachelor party I have ever been to  (and I have been to a lot). I will be highly recomending your company  to anyone throwing a party in the future. </p>
   <p>Thanks  again!<br />

   <p>Just  wanted to thank you and the &quot;police officer&quot; for a great time Saturday  night in Allendale, NJ.  He was prompt, courteous, a good sport and  very accommodating.  Our birthday girl will never forget it.  I will  keep the info for future reference and recommend your firm to anyone  who might ask.<br />
        <br />
        Thank you again.<br />

   <p>I  want to thank you for the amazing job you and your team at Centerfold  Strips did in helping me with my entertainment and talent needs for my  best friend’s bachelor party.  As you well know, I designed my party to  be a bit different than the typical bachelor party and my needs were  quite customized and rather involved. You not only enthusiastically  engaged in helping me figure out how to execute my plan, you came  through above and beyond in terms of your service level as well as your  arranging to have your best, most talented entertainers at my party.   You matched personality, attitude, and looks perfectly for my event.    It was also very nice to know someone on your team was always just a  phone call away during the planning stage to put my mind at ease when I  was stressed out trying to plan a party of this magnitude and detail.  Thanks to you and your amazing team at Centerfold, my party did come  off not only as I had envisioned, but above and beyond my highest  expectations.  </p>
   <p>I have been a best man in two  wedding prior to this and worked with other entertainers and none have  compared to your company’s level of professionalism as well as value.   The good news is that I have another Best Man role upcoming for  another great friend’s wedding this summer.  For this next one, and as  many more parties as my future may hold, I know exactly who to call for  my entertainment needs. </p>
   <p>Thanks  so much.  <br />
        Sincere  Cheers, </p>

   <p>I had to write you an email to thank you for providing the entertainment for a bachelor party I hosted on 10/15. I booked a duo, Alexis &amp;  Rio, on John's recommendation, for the festivities and could not have  been more pleased when they showed up with Bianca as well. Although it  was more than we were looking to spend by hiring Bianca in addition, I  must say it was more than worth the extra money. Alexis, Rio, and  Bianca are not only incredibly gorgeous, but have incredibly warm, fun,  and friendly personalities as well. They gave us the best show anyone  in our group had ever experienced at a bachelor party without question.  All of the guests were consistently thanking me for hiring the girls  and asking what company I used. This is the second time I've used  Centerfold Strips, and dealing with John for this event was nothing  short of an absolute pleasure. There is no need for me to look any  further for the entertainment for my next party - you guys are the  best! Thank you again! </p>

   <p>I  wanted to take a minute to write you a short note, telling you how  pleased I was to have worked you and Centerfold Strips on Friday 7/1/05  in the Havanna Room during my best friends bachelor party. </p>
   <p>Even though me and the  bachelor showed up over an hour late you and your girls accomodated us  by adjusting your schedules to make sure we had the best time of our  life. First and foremost the ladies your work with i.e. Tina, Jasmine,  and Bianca were absolutely hands down gorgeous, extremely friendly,  with great attitudes. Oh and O So Soft.... They're show was unmatched  by any show we have ever experienced in the same type of setting. They  gave full attention to the bachelor and ensured he had a night to  remember, all while keeping the other guest captivated by their  exhilerating feverish show. </p>
   <p>Thank you for making me truly &quot;the best man&quot; </p>

   <p>I  just wanted to let you know that Apollo was great. He was such a  sweetheart and was a great entertainer. The surprise was great for  everyone. He deserves a raise! </p>

   <p>Just  wanted to thank you for helping to provide a memorable evening for me  and my customers on Friday night.  The night went off without a hitch  and the girls were great.  Hopefully, we can do it again.  </p>
   <p>Regards,</p>

   <p>THANK  YOU! We had a f*@#ing great time last night! You guys really are the  best. I was a little overwhelmed in planning my buddy's bachelor party,  but you really hooked me up. Adrienne and Troy gave our bachelor a  fantastic show. It usually takes the Red Sox to get my friends wound up  that much! Everyone from the party has thanked me, so I had to pass it  on. I'll wait impatiently until the next time I have an excuse to call  you guys again.</p>

   <p>We  had a party on Saturday (10/4) and had booked 'James' through your  service. I just wanted to tell you that we had the greatest time and  that James made the party a huge success....He did a great job and we  all can't wait for our fiftieth birthday!!! Thanks... </p>

   <p>Hello....  I wrote you guys an email the other day asking about your service for a  friend of mine. Your responded very quickly. That very next day I spoke  with my friend Becky, and she said that she had hired you guys. She was  very excited about speaking with you, especially the entertainer named  Tony that she hired. She said you were all very professional and  courteous over the phone. </p>
   <p>I  was a little nervous about giving her the name of a company I found  over the Internet, but you guys turned out to be the real thing. If  anyone asks me for a referral, I will definitely give them your  company's name. </p>

   <p>This  is just a quick note to thank you for all of your help last week in  planning my last minute bachelor party for my brother. I could not have  gotten through the planning without your help, and of course the  entertainment you provided was - lets just say magnificent. I have  gotten calls from everyone at the party commending you and the girls on  their performance and asking where I booked them. Of course, I am  sending them all to Dan-The-Man at Centerfold Strips. Look for calls  from George and my friend Steve who are both getting married in the  next two months. </p>
   <p>Thanks Again!<br />

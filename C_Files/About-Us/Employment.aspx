<p><a href="employment-app.aspx"><img src="../images/applicationButton.gif" alt="Fill Out An Application" width="186" height="41" class="floatRight" /></a>First of all, throw out all of your preconceived notions about the entertainment industry. Welcome to Centerfold Strips, and our                 job is to help you make money while offering immediate hire and                 the opportunity to make some of the highest pay rates in the industry.                 Our service will NEVER ask you to do any escorting or provide any                 other service to our customers other than dancing. We are extremely                 professional with our talent, and that relationship allows for a                 stress free and fun working environment.</p>
<p>We are also a professionally licensed booking agency for adult entertainment. We book private parties for all occasions, including bachelor parties, bachelorette parties, birthday parties, sporting                 events, strip – o – grams, and corporate functions throughout                 the United States. The job is extremely safe, due to the fact that                 we send professional, trained security personnel / drivers with                 you to each and every job. We pride ourselves in being the most                 upscale agency in the industry.</p>
<p>As talent managers and agents of exotic dancers, feature entertainers and models in the adult genres of entertainment, our primary function is to guide, develop, enhance, and direct the careers of our talent                 in a way that is suitable to their long-term goals.</p>
<p>Our working relationships with photographers, publishers, directors, producers, fashion and magazine editors, as well as film, TV, and commercial talent agents are designed to achieve added exposure                 for our managed talent.</p>
<p>We are looking for entertainers that have it all; good looks, talent, imagination and originality that they incorporate into their performance.                 Reliability, honesty, and a friendly, outgoing personality are a                 must. Our dancers are entertainers. They are not there just to take                 their clothes off. They are fully aware that they are the entertainment,                 the highlight of each special occasion. It is extremely important                 to us that our customers get what they paid for and expect –                 attractive, hassle free, classy, and friendly entertainment that                 is on time and professional.</p>
<p>We also understand the delicate nature and confidentiality some people require with working in this industry. Your confidentiality                 and discretion is upheld at all times. We can provide you work outside                 your local area for added discretion if you so choose.</p>
<p>Repeat business is extremely important, through building relationships with our clients. We keep our customers coming back by giving them                 the quality that no other agency can match. We differ from other                 agencies in many ways. We do not believe our dancers work for us,                 but they work with us. We will never ask you to do anything you                 do not feel comfortable with. Each entertainer has their own limits                 and their shows range from mild to wild. We assign shows based on                 what the customer requests and the performing style of each individual                 dancer. We will never send you to a show where the customer wants                 a wilder performance than you like to do. </p>
<p>We do everything possible to take care of our exotic dancers, and hope for the same respect and loyalty in return. This policy has                 worked for years and we can proudly say we have some of the greatest                 entertainers working with us. </p>
<p>No experience is necessary. If you feel you have the good looks and personality, we will arrange for you to go watch as many shows                 as you need before giving it a try. We always suggest you try performing                 for the first time for a song or two at another entertainer’s                 show after they have performed. But not until you yourself decide                 you want to. This is a great way to get rid of the jitters that                 most new dancers have. Customers are usually very nice and enjoy                 being your first audience and the other girl / guy is there to help                 you and encourage the crowd. </p>
<p>If this interests you and you are still reading this, then please email us an application. You are not obligated to take the job.                 You make the decision after speaking to us and or seeing a few shows. </p>
<p><strong>This is a fantastic way to make a lot of money for the right individuals</strong>. We offer absolutely top $ pay and flexible                 hours with immediate hire. This career is suitable for college students,                 single young moms, or just a weekend job to provide extra income.                 Whatever your motivation, just contact us with any questions you               may have. We look forward to meeting you.</p>

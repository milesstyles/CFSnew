    <p>Knock on the wrought iron speakeasy window and you may be ushered into the Speakeasy Room, a slice of old New York and the Upper Westside's premier private-party space. As the bartender pours you a strong drink and sets it on the long, dark bar, candlelight plays along the exposed brick walls and vaulted ceilings. Accommodating from 20 to 125 people, offering a full catering menu, audio/visual capabilities with a PA system for bands, a built-in stage, an alcove of cabaret tables around a gas fireplace, The Speakeasy Room hosts any type of party with the style and grace that built Manhattan (and the good cheer that ended prohibition!).</p></asp:Content>

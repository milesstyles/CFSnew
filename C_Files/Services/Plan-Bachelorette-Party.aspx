<p>When to Host a Bachelorette Party - Bachelorette parties  have become popular recently because wedding events have become so formal. If  the guest list for the bridal shower included more than close friends it is  probably a good idea to plan some bachelorette party activities. The bride will  be busy during the weeks before her wedding. You are your close friends will  want to get on her calendar in advance.</p>
<p>What makes a bachelorette party different from a bridal  shower?<br />
     A bachelorette party is a much less formal affair. The guest list  does not require the invitation of parents, relatives, or anyone. It is a time  for the bride's closest friends to go out and celebrate her big night of being  single. A bachelorette party honors the bride without requiring anything of  her. She will welcome the break from the rigid requirements of bridal showers,  rehearsal dinners, and the wedding planning.</p>
<p>Whom do I invite to the bachelorette party? <br />
     The bride is  required. The bridesmaids are probably also a sure thing. After that, you can  invite as many or as few people as you want. We would suggest inviting only  people that the bride is very comfortable with. Ask yourself &quot;If the bride  was to get really drunk who would be OK with it?” In most cases, the mother of  the groom is out of the question. Even the mother of the bride might not be  appropriate.</p>
<p>When should I hold the bachelorette party?<br />
     It is probably  best if the bachelorette party is held at least two weeks in advance of the  wedding. Most people hold them after the bridal shower. This prevents people  who were not invited from being angry at the shower.</p>
<p>Should I call it a bachelorette party or just a girl's night  out? <br />
     The term bachelorette party was invented because the night out is in  response to guys having a bachelor party. If you think people might be offended  by the prospect of a bachelorette party, just suggest a girl's night out.  Decoupling the event from the wedding will be helpful in keeping people from  feeling left out.</p>
<p>Weekend or Weekday?<br />
     Weekend.</p>
<p>Stay in or go out?<br />
     Most parties start at someone's place and  then go out to a favorite bar or club.</p>
<p>Stripper? <br />
     Why not? Most parties have one or two male  strippers come in costume for 30 min or one hour. Simply got to <a href="http://www.centerfoldstrips.com/">www.centerfoldstrips.com</a> or call  toll free 877-427-8747. </p>
<p>What type of food should I serve at the bachelorette party?<br />
     This is definitely one area where bachelorette parties and bridal showers differ.  Standard bachelorette party fare includes items that are easily acquired and  low effort. Think chips, veggie trays, a silly cake and having pizza delivered.</p>
<p>Should I serve drinks at the bachelorette party? <br />
     Definitely.  Pre-made cocktails will make the party a big hit. Most stores sell margarita,  daiquiri, or cosmopolitan mixes that are as easy as can be. You can mix them in  a drink pitcher and serve the gang. Adult drinking straws are extremely  popular.</p>
<p>What do people do at a bachelorette party? <br />
     For the most part  it is just a fun night spent with friends and possibly some hot Strippers.  Other activities include drinking, dancing, hiring a limo., going to a show, a  bar crawl, or visiting a favorite restaurant.</p>
<p>What is appropriate attire for a bachelorette party? <br />
     Bar  clothes. In other word's your cutest, trendiest outfit. Somewhat whorish but  not too borish.</p>
<p>Who pays for the bachelorette party? <br />
     We suggest using the  same method that guys use for a bachelor party. It is not unusual for you to  charge the guests. Use the money collected to pay for any food you serve, any  entertainment you provide, decorations, gifts for the bride and any  transportation you provide. If you are going out charge a little bit extra. The  amount left over is called &quot;the stag&quot;. Use it to purchase the bride's  drinks during the evening. If you keep the amount requested to around $25-$75  per person and you provide them with drinks, fun and favors they will be more  than happy.</p>
<p>More tips on throwing a great bachelorette party:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Arrange a designated driver, hire a limo, or call  cabs.</li>
     <li>Call ahead to wherever you are going to request a nice  table or special treatment. Most bars and clubs know that bachelorette parties  are good customers and will do something nice for your group or the bride. </li>
     <li>Have a way to call attention to the bride. A tiara or sash  is a great choice. This is her big night, so all of the attention will make her  feel special.</li>
     <li>Mail out invitations in advance. That way you can get on  everyone's calendar and no one important will miss the festivities. Invitations  also really set the theme and get people excited about attending.</li>
